# Grand Circus Final Project
This is a ReadMe. It can be used to explain what the project is and how it's evolved, in a general sense. Also communicating basic ideas about the application's function. 

### Features
-What the app does can go here.

### Planned Features
This should be self-explanatory.

##### [2.1.1] - 11/27/2018<br>
-The newest version number goes at the top. Like Twitter.

##### [2.1.0] - 11/27/2018<br>
-A big change that doesn't majorly change the core functionality of the app or the main visual style of the app would be a .1 release.<br>

##### [2.0.1] - 11/26/2018<br>
-Bug fixes, copy editing, and very minor visual tweaks would constitute only a .0.1 release iteration.

##### [2.0.0] - 11/25/2018<br>
-A new whole version number would constitute a change that majorly changes the function of the app or majorly changes the visual style of the app.

##### [1.1.0] - 11/25/2018<br>
-The date helps keep track, and time would be even better. It's unlikely we'll be needing to update this frequently enough to include time, though.

##### [1.0.0] - 11/24/2018<br>
-The first version number/commit should probably *not* start at 1.0.0. At the time of writing this, we're not even at 0.0.1, yet.

There should be some sort of credit somewhere in here.
